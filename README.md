## Introduction

The Link Extractor program is a Rust application that allows you to extract hyperlinks from a web page. It utilizes popular Rust libraries such as `reqwest` for making HTTP requests and `select` for HTML parsing.

## Error Handling

We've implemented error handling using the `error_chain` crate to provide clear and concise error messages. Here are the main error types:

- `ReqError`: Represents errors from the `reqwest` library when making HTTP requests.
- `Io`: Represents errors related to input and output operations.

## How it Works

This program:

1. Sends an HTTP GET request to a specified URL (in this case, "https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/").
2. Retrieves the HTML content of the web page.
3. Parses the HTML content to find all anchor (`<a>`) elements.
4. Extracts the `href` attribute of each anchor element.
5. Prints the extracted links to the console.

## Usage

To use the Link Extractor program, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Rust installed on your system.

2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/link-extractor.git
   cd link-extractor
   ```

3. Build and run the program:

   ```bash
   cargo build
   cargo run
   ```

   This will execute the program and print the extracted links to the console.
